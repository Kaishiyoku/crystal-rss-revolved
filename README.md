# Crystal RSS (revolved)

Documenation: https://kaishi.gitbook.io/crystal-rss/

Crystal RSS is a minimalist newsfeed reader.

The features are limited by intention to be able to concentrate on what matters: reading the news.

Any RSS feed can be added and article summaries are then being fetched and displayed on the dashboard automatically.

The feed reader is optimized for usage on smartphones.
